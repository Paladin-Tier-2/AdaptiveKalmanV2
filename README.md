# **Adaptive Kalman Filter for Ultrasonic Sensor with ESP32**

## 📜 **Project Description**

This repository contains an implementation of an **Adaptive Kalman Filter** for smoothing sensor readings from an **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor**. The system uses an **ESP32 microcontroller** and dynamically adjusts the Kalman filter's noise covariance matrices \( R \) and \( Q \) based on innovations and residuals, inspired by the paper:

- Akhlaghi, N., Zhou, and Z. Huang, _"Adaptive adjustment of noise covariance in Kalman filter for dynamic state estimation,"_ in **2017 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting**.

## 🛠️ **Hardware & Tools**

### **Hardware Components**
- **ESP32 Microcontroller**  
- **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor**  
- **USB Boost Converter (for powering ESP32)**  

### **Software & Frameworks**
- **PlatformIO**  
- **Arduino Core for ESP32**  
- **nhatuan84's TinyEKF Library (Modified for Adaptivity)**  

---

## 🧩 **Features**
- **Real-Time Adaptive Tuning** of \( R \) and \( Q \) for accurate and smooth data.  
- Seamless integration with Wi-Fi using ESP32 for remote data transmission.  
- Flask server integration for data logging and analysis.  
- First-order system implementation for simplicity and efficiency.

## ⚙️ **Setup Instructions**

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/esp32-adaptive-kalman.git
cd esp32-adaptive-kalman
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**
- Install **PlatformIO**: [PlatformIO Installation Guide](https://platformio.org/install)

  - **TinyEKF (nhatuan84's Kalman Filter)**

```bash
pio lib install "TinyEKF"
```

### **3. Upload Code to ESP32**
- Configure your **`platformio.ini`** file with the correct board settings for your ESP32.
- Connect your ESP32 to your computer and upload the code:
```bash
pio run --target upload
```

## 🌐 **Python Flask Server**

### **Setup Flask Server**
1. Navigate to the `flask_server/` directory:
   ```bash
   cd flask_server
   ```
2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```
3. Run the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```
4. Access the server at `http://<your-local-ip>:5000`.

## 🧪 **Experiments & Results**

- **Prototype Setup:**  
  A battery-powered test setup was built to simulate real-world scenarios. The ESP32 transmits sensor readings wirelessly to the Flask server.

- **Filter Performance:**  
  The Adaptive Kalman Filter effectively smooths noisy data, as illustrated in the figure below (insert your plots or images here).
