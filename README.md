## 🌐 Python Flask Server

### Flask Server Code (`server.py`)


#### Explanation

- **Purpose:** Receives data from the ESP32 via HTTP POST requests and logs it to a CSV file (`measurements.csv`).
- **Data Validation:** Ensures all required fields are present in the incoming JSON data.
- **Data Storage:** Appends the received data to `measurements.csv` for later analysis or live plotting.

#### Instructions

- Ensure Python 3 is installed.
- Install Flask by running `pip install flask`.
- Run the server using `python server.py`.

---

## 📊 MATLAB Live Data Plotting

### MATLAB Script (`live_plot.m`)

- **Purpose:** Reads the `measurements.csv` file generated by the Flask server and plots the raw and filtered distance data in real-time.
- **Live Plotting:** Updates the plot at intervals specified by `samplingInterval` to reflect new data.
- **Usage:** Run the script in MATLAB after starting the Flask server.



## 🧪 Experiments & Results

### Prototype Setup

A battery-powered test setup was built to simulate real-world scenarios. The ESP32 transmits sensor readings wirelessly to the Flask server.

### Filter Performance

### Observations

- The filter accurately filters out undesired peaks and flattens out the noisy measurements.
- The adaptive adjustment of \( R \) and \( Q \) allows the filter to respond to changes in measurement noise dynamically.

### Kalman Filter Guide

The Kalman filter is an algorithm that provides estimates of some unknown variables given the measurements observed over time. Below are the key components and variables used in this implementation:

- **n**: Number of **states** in the system.
- **m**: Number of **measurement values**.

#### Variables and Matrices

- **xc[n]**: Corrected (updated) state vector at time \( k \).
  - Represents the estimated state after considering the measurement.
- **xp[n]**: Predicted state vector at time \( k \).
  - Represents the state prediction based on the previous state and the system model.
- **A[n][n]**: System dynamics matrix.
  - Describes how the system evolves from one state to the next without considering the process noise or control input.
- **H[m][n]**: Measurement matrix.
  - Maps the true state space into the observed space.
- **Q[n][n]**: Process noise covariance matrix.
  - Represents the covariance of the process noise, accounting for uncertainties in the system model.
- **R[m][m]**: Measurement noise covariance matrix.
  - Represents the covariance of the measurement noise, accounting for uncertainties in the sensor measurements.
- **P[n][n]**: Estimate error covariance matrix.
  - Represents the error covariance in the state estimate.

#### Kalman Filter Equations

1. **Prediction Step:**

   - **State Prediction:**
     \[ \hat{x}_{k|k-1} = A \hat{x}_{k-1|k-1} \]
   - **Covariance Prediction:**
     \[ P_{k|k-1} = A P_{k-1|k-1} A^T + Q \]

2. **Update (Correction) Step:**

   - **Kalman Gain Calculation:**
     \[ K_k = P_{k|k-1} H^T (H P_{k|k-1} H^T + R)^{-1} \]
   - **State Update:**
     \[ \hat{x}_{k|k} = \hat{x}_{k|k-1} + K_k (z_k - H \hat{x}_{k|k-1}) \]
   - **Covariance Update:**
     \[ P_{k|k} = (I - K_k H) P_{k|k-1} \]

#### Adaptive Adjustment Equations

- **Innovation (Predicted Residual):**
  \[ d_k = z_k - H \hat{x}_{k|k-1} \]
- **Residual (Measurement Residual):**
  \[ \epsilon_k = z_k - H \hat{x}_{k|k} \]

- **Adaptive Update of R:**
  \[ R_k = \alpha R_{k-1} + (1 - \alpha)(\epsilon_k \epsilon_k^T + H P_{k|k-1} H^T) \]

- **Adaptive Update of Q:**
  \[ Q_k = \alpha Q_{k-1} + (1 - \alpha)(K_k d_k d_k^T K_k^T) \]

#### Parameters

- **\( \alpha \)**: Forgetting factor (0 < \( \alpha \) < 1).
  - Controls the weight given to new measurements versus the existing estimate.
- **\( K_k \)**: Kalman Gain at time \( k \).
  - Determines how much the predictions are corrected based on the new measurement.
- **\( z_k \)**: Measurement at time \( k \).

### Implementation Notes

- In this project, we are using a **first-order system**, so \( n = m = 1 \).
- The state vector \( x \) represents the distance measured by the ultrasonic sensor.
- The system dynamics matrix \( A \) is set to **1**, assuming a constant system without any control input.
- The measurement matrix \( H \) is also set to **1**, directly mapping the state to the measurement.
- The process and measurement noise covariances \( Q \) and \( R \) are initialized with small positive values and are updated adaptively.

### Code Snippet for Variable Initialization

In `main.cpp`, the Kalman filter variables are initialized as follows:

```cpp
int stateNum = 1;     // Number of states (n)
int measureNum = 1;   // Number of measurements (m)

float xc[1];          // Corrected state vector
float xp[1];          // Predicted state vector
float A[1][1];        // System dynamics matrix
float Q[1][1];        // Process noise covariance
float R[1][1];        // Measurement noise covariance
float H[1][1];        // Measurement matrix
float P[1][1];        // Estimate error covariance

// Initialization
A[0][0] = 1.0f;       // Assuming a constant system
H[0][0] = 1.0f;       // Direct measurement
Q[0][0] = 0.01f;      // Initial process noise covariance
R[0][0] = 0.1f;       // Initial measurement noise covariance
P[0][0] = 1.0f;       // Initial estimate error covariance
```

**Note:** It's important to start the Flask server **after** the ESP32 is connected to the Wi-Fi hotspot created by your laptop. This ensures that the server is ready to receive data, and there are no connection issues.

# Important Tips

- **Hotspot Connection:** When testing, ensure your laptop's hotspot is active and the ESP32 is configured to connect to it.
- **Serial Monitoring:** Use a serial monitor to observe the ESP32's status messages.
- **Data Synchronization:** Starting the server after the ESP32 is connected prevents data loss and ensures all measurements are logged.
